# Basics
A. Multiplication Table using 'for' loop.
The program takes a number and a limit as input and then prints the multiplication table for that number up to the given limit.

B. Multiplication Table using 'while' loop.
The program takes a number and a limit as input and then prints the multiplication table for that number up to the given limit using a while loop.

C. Display 2 digit number in words. The program takes a two-digit number as input and then prints the English words for each digit using a switch statement.

D. Display a digit in words
The program takes a digit as input and then prints the English word for that digit using a switch statement.

E. Bit Shifting
The program reads an integer number and then left-shifts it by 8 bits to create a new integer newnumber.
Algorithm:

F. Reverse a number
The program reverses the digits of an input number.

G. Basic Operations on two integer inputs. The program takes three integer inputs (Var1, Var2, and Var3), performs various mathematical operations.
It assigns a new value to Var3.
